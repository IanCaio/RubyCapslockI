# Capslock Indicator

Author: Ian Caio

## Description

An Unity indicator that shows the Capslock state.

## How-to use

- Run `./install.sh` to install the indicator in the ~/Executables/CapslockI/ folder.
- The install script will create a .desktop entry so the indicator is automatically loaded on startup.
- Click on the indicator on the panel and then "Quit" to leave the program.
- To uninstall, run `./uninstall.sh` which will remove the script and the .desktop entry.
